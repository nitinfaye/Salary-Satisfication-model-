# Salary-Satisfication-model-
You have to clean this data, prepare it for ML models, build more features and ultimately build a random forest (scikit).
Split the dataset into 80:20, train:test. 
Print the Weighted F1 on test dataset (target_satisfaction) and RMSE (Target_salary)

Please note - 
If you do this problem without any cleaning or building any additional features, you won't get the RMSE or good F1. There are lots of variables which need feature engineering. 

Follow the usual data science process. 

Please if you plan to submit any random value, we wonâ€™t be giving you a call , since even before running your code in google colab, we know the possible range of answers.
